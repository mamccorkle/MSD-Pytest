Testing with Pytest

## Objective

The purpose of this assignment is to introduce you to unit testing with pytest and debugging using PyCharm. You will write tests for a buggy Python script, fix the identified issues, and document the process.

## Assignment Tasks

```
* Git Repository
    * Inside your repository, create a folder called pytest_assignment/ (or something equally descriptive)
    * Place all files related to this assignment inside this folder.
* Analyze the Provided Python Script (program.py)
    * This script contains three functions, each with one or more bugs.
    * Your goal is to identify and write tests for these functions.
* Write Unit Tests (test_program.py)
    * Use pytest to create at least three tests per function.
    * Tests should cover a normal cases, an edge cases, and a corner cases.
* Run Tests and Capture Proof
    * Run your tests in PyCharm and take a screenshot of all tests passing (showing at least 9 green checks).
    * Save the screenshot as proof.png.
* Fix Bugs and Document Fixes (fixes.md)
    * After running your tests, fix the identified issues in program.py.
    * Document each fix in fixes.md, explaining:
        * What the bug was.
        * How you identified it.
    * What fix you applied.
* Submit Your Work
    * Push your code and test files to your GitHub repository.
    * Upload the repository link via the submission portal.
```

Supplied Code (program.py)

This script contains intentional bugs for you to find and fix.

```python
def divide_numbers(a, b):
    """Returns the result of a divided by b, rounded to two decimals."""
    result = a / b  # Bug: No handling for division by zero
    return round(result, 2)

def reverse_string(s):
    """Returns the reversed string, with each character's case flipped."""
    reversed_s = s[::-1]  # Bug: Might not handle non-string input properly
    flipped_case = ''.join([char.swapcase() for char in reversed_s])
    return flipped_case

def get_list_element(lst, index):
    """Returns the element at the given index in the list, or 'Not found' if out of range."""
    if index < len(lst):  # Bug: Incorrect boundary check
        return lst[index]
    else:
        return "Not found"  # Bug: Should probably raise an exception instead
```

## Example Test File (test_program.py)

#### This is an example of how you might structure your pytest tests.

```python
import pytest
from program import divide_numbers, reverse_string, get_list_element

def test_divide_numbers():
    assert divide_numbers(10, 3) == 3.33
```

## Deliverables

```
program.py (original script with bugs)
test_program.py (pytest tests covering edge cases)
proof.png (screenshot of all tests passing)
fixes.md (list of identified bugs & fixes)
